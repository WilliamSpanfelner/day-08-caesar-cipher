# Encrypt and decrypt with Caesar's cipher. And refactor.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  
- 🧑‍💻  Cryptography and Caesar's shift cipher - one of the oldest encryption techniques - is explored in this project.  Functions, functions that allow for inputs, Python's version of arrays - lists, loops, conditionals, indices, refactoring and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
- 📫 How to reach me...
